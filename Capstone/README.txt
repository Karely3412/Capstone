## WORKING WITH THE CAPSTONE PROJECT APPLICATION

There are test data hardcoded in the code to make it easier to work with the project.

# Users

There are 3 test users whose credentials you may use to interact with the application.

* There are 2 ordinary (Employee) accounts
	* One belongs to John, credentials are employee : test
	* The other belongs to Brian, credentials are employee_2 : test
* There is one manager account
	* Belongs to Jane, credentials are manager : test

You may use the manager account to create new users.

I believe the rest of the functionalities are straight forward. 
When you first run the app, you'll have to login and depending on the account you'll use, you will have different menu options. The manager account has more options. Each user can change their own credentials but the manager can change anyone's account
